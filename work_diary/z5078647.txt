Currently learning how to use Jira properly and for purposes of project management. 
Communication is via microsoft teams and we are brainstorming ideas of what should/can be implemented for our project.

The following were my parts and were completed as a part of drafting the proposal:

Week 4

Researched about vue.js, django and auth0. Began using those to create a landing page to form an understanding of how they worked together, but had decided to use django rest framework instead. Burton created initial backend, therefore had to 
wait until it was completed.
