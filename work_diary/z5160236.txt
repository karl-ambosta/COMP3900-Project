Week 1

- Group "Tues14" was formed and decided to use Microsfot Teams as a way of communicating ideas and storing project files. Project #6 - "Waiter" was chosen to be the project that we would work on. Started brainstorming on possible features that could be implemented into the project and how we could merged multiple projects in order to obtain a better mark. 

Week 2

- Talked about the sections that needed to be included in the Project Proposal due next week and allocated sections to group members. I was allocated the system flow diagram. As such, a system flow diagram for each different type of user was needed (Customer, Cashier, Waiter, Kitcher Staff and Management). Also added user stories for the Management user to the Jira board.

Week 3

- Fixed up the system flow diagrams to better showcase the structure and the content that will be displayed on each screen, as per our tutors feedback. Our group has chosen to use Python/Django for the back-end and Vue.js and Bootstrap for the front-end. The rest of the week has been spent practicing using Vue.js along with Python to create various different features that can be added to our webpages.

Week 4

- Started working on the landing pages for the website in HTML, before we use Django and Vue to display it. A basic skeleton has been completed during the tutorial and now the CSS/Bootstrap on the pages will be completed over the week to display more like the finish product. Aim to finish the landing page and all adjoining pages for next week's demo.

Week 5

- This week, Joel and myself decided to work together on the first type of ser screens and the customer screens were tasked to finish. After this week, we will break off and work on separate user screens to get through the fron-end faster. I have completed most of the screens that the customer will use to access when using the app. After finishing most of the screens, I have decided for next week, to work on adding Vue to the html page, as was planned for the project.

Week 6

- This week, Joel and I continued to work through the rest of the different user pages. Joel had started on the cashier, kitchen stafd and waiter pages, while I went back through the landing pages and customer pages to make the layouts more responsive. After that I worked on the management pages, which includes the dashboard, menu editing, history and old items pages. Also, Ali gave some ideas on extending the customer pages. Some included: allowing app to track user's position to determine the closest restaurant near them, autofill customer name, customise item from the menu ordering screen. Some extra feature idea he gave us were: dividing bills and use of qr codes. These will be worked on in future weeks.

Week 7
This week, I continue to work on the admin/menu_edit and dashboards to correct some errors and to implement a few more functionalities. As well as this, I have started working on connecting the front-end with GET, POST, etc. requests to our django api.

Week 8

= This week, I continued work on connecting the front and back ends of the project through request to the django api, from the front end. I am to complete the GET and POST to /menuItems/ and /menuCategories/. There is still a few things to correct on the admin/menu_edit.html as well.
