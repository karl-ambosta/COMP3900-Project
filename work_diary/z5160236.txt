Week 1

- Group "Tues14" was formed and decided to use Microsfot Teams as a way of communicating ideas and storing project files. Project #6 - "Waiter" was chosen to be the project that we would work on. Started brainstorming on possible features that could be implemented into the project and how we could merged multiple projects in order to obtain a better mark. 

Week 2

- Talked about the sections that needed to be included in the Project Proposal due next week and allocated sections to group members. I was allocated the system flow diagram. As such, a system flow diagram for each different type of user was needed (Customer, Cashier, Waiter, Kitcher Staff and Management). Also added user stories for the Management user to the Jira board.
